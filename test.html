                This Team's model of Buy One, Give One makes it so easy for anyone to contribute through the purchase of something as simple as a lunch.They are the catering choice that makes a big difference. Every lunch you buy means we can give a lunch to a Kiwi kid who would otherwise go without. It’s a little gesture that’s had a great impact for so many Kiwi kids. With a good lunch in their tummies, the kids do better in so many ways from helping them focus on learning to simply just putting a smile on their faces.</strong>.
